Your **Medicare Annual Wellness Visit** (AWV) is one of the most valuable preventive benefits available to you—and it's covered at no cost when you visit a participating provider like HCI Medical Group.

## What Is an Annual Wellness Visit?

The Annual Wellness Visit is a yearly appointment focused on prevention and creating a personalized health plan. Unlike a regular checkup or physical exam, the AWV is designed to:

- Review your health risk factors
- Create or update your personalized prevention plan
- Screen for cognitive impairment
- Review your medications and health history
- Discuss advance care planning

## What to Expect During Your Visit

When you arrive for your Annual Wellness Visit at HCI Medical Group, our team will:

### 1. Update Your Health History

We'll review any changes to your health since your last visit, including new diagnoses, hospitalizations, or specialist consultations.

### 2. Check Your Vital Signs

Your height, weight, blood pressure, and other measurements help us track changes in your health over time.

### 3. Assess Your Health Risks

We'll discuss factors like your family history, lifestyle habits, and current health conditions to identify potential risks.

### 4. Create Your Prevention Plan

Based on your individual needs, we'll recommend appropriate screenings, vaccinations, and preventive services for the coming year.

## First Visit vs. Subsequent Visits

**Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE):** If you're new to Medicare, you're eligible for a one-time "Welcome to Medicare" visit within the first 12 months of enrollment.

**Annual Wellness Visit:** After your first year, you can schedule an AWV every 12 months to maintain your personalized prevention plan.

## How to Prepare

To get the most from your Annual Wellness Visit:

- Bring a list of all current medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements
- Write down any health concerns or questions you'd like to discuss
- Bring records of any care you've received from other providers
- Consider bringing a family member who can help with health history

## Schedule Your Visit

At HCI Medical Group, we're committed to helping you make the most of your Medicare benefits. Our experienced team takes the time to understand your unique health needs and works with you to develop a prevention plan that supports your goals.
